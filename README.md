# a tailwindcss project ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤˜

The purpose of the project is to practice tailwindcss. I used this website as a reference [tailwind-page](https://anuj-kumar-sharma.github.io/tailwind-landing-page/#). However, i recreated this website using react.
Here is a live preview of my project [link](https://66ca3e599d7767467aca9702--gleaming-macaron-a11a2d.netlify.app/)
